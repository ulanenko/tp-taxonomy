Statement of the arm\u2019s length principle\nB.1 Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention\n1.6 The authoritative statement of the arm\u2019s length principle is found\nin paragraph 1 of Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention, which\nforms the basis of bilateral tax treaties involving OECD member countries\nand an increasing number of non-member countries. Article 9 provides:\n[Where] conditions are made or imposed between the\ntwo [associated] enterprises in their commercial or\nfinancial relations which differ from those which\nwould be made between independent enterprises, then\nany profits which would, but for those conditions,\nhave accrued to one of the enterprises, but, by reason\nof those conditions, have not so accrued, may be\nincluded in the profits of that enterprise and taxed\naccordingly.\nBy seeking to adjust profits by reference to the conditions which would have\nobtained between independent enterprises in comparable transactions and\ncomparable circumstances (i.e. in \u201ccomparable uncontrolled transactions\u201d),\nthe arm\u2019s length principle follows the approach of treating the members of\nan MNE group as operating as separate entities rather than as inseparable\nparts of a single unified business. Because the separate entity approach treats\nthe members of an MNE group as if they were independent entities,\nattention is focused on the nature of the transactions between those members\nand on whether the conditions thereof differ from the conditions that would\nbe obtained in comparable uncontrolled transactions. Such an analysis of the\ncontrolled and uncontrolled transactions, which is referred to as a\n\u201ccomparability analysis\u201d, is at the heart of the application of the arm\u2019s\nlength principle. Guidance on the comparability analysis is found in Section\nD below and in Chapter III.\n1.7 It is important to put the issue of comparability into perspective in\norder to emphasise the need for an approach that is balanced in terms of, on\nthe one hand, its reliability and, on the other, the burden it creates for\ntaxpayers and tax administrations. Paragraph 1 of Article 9 of the OECD\nModel Tax Convention is the foundation for comparability analyses because\nit introduces the need for:\n\u2022 A comparison between conditions (including prices, but not only\nprices) made or imposed between associated enterprises and those\nwhich would be made between independent enterprises, in order to\ndetermine whether a re-writing of the accounts for the purposes of\n36 \u2013 CHAPTER I: THE ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE\nOECD TRANSFER PRICING GUIDELINES \u00a9 OECD 2017\ncalculating tax liabilities of associated enterprises is authorised\nunder Article 9 of the OECD Model Tax Convention (see\nparagraph 2 of the Commentary on Article 9); and\n\u2022 A determination of the profits which would have accrued at arm\u2019s\nlength, in order to determine the quantum of any re-writing of\naccounts.\n1.8 There are several reasons why OECD member countries and other\n"

While it\nmay not always be straightforward to apply in practice, it does generally\nproduce appropriate levels of income between members of MNE groups,\nacceptable to tax administrations. This reflects the economic realities of the\ncontrolled taxpayer\u2019s particular facts and circumstances and adopts as a\nbenchmark the normal operation of the market.\n1.15 A move away from the arm\u2019s length principle would abandon the\nsound theoretical basis described above and threaten the international\nconsensus, thereby substantially increasing the risk of double taxation.\nExperience under the arm\u2019s length principle has become sufficiently broad\nand sophisticated to establish a substantial body of common understanding\namong the business community and tax administrations. This shared\nunderstanding is of great practical value in achieving the objectives of\nsecuring the appropriate tax base in each jurisdiction and avoiding double\ntaxation. This experience should be drawn on to elaborate the arm\u2019s length\nprinciple further, to refine its operation, and to improve its administration by\nproviding clearer guidance to taxpayers and more timely examinations.

    "content": "exchange rate movements. Although exchange rate movements can\ncomplicate application of the arm's length principle they do not have the\nsame impact as for global formulary apportionment; the arm's length\nprinciple is better equipped to deal with the economic consequences of\nexchange rate movements because it requires the analysis of the specific\nfacts and circumstances of the taxpayer. If the formula relies on costs, the\nresult of applying a global formulary apportionment would be that as a\nparticular currency strengthens in one country consistently against another\ncurrency in which an associated enterprise keeps its accounts, a greater share\nof the profit would be attributed to the enterprise in the first country to\nreflect the costs of its payroll nominally increased by the currency\nfluctuation. Thus, under a global formulary apportionment, the exchange\nrate movement in this example would lead to increasing the profits of the\nassociated enterprise operating with the stronger currency whereas in the\nlong run a strengthening currency makes exports less competitive and leads\nto a downward pressure on profits.\n42 \u2013 CHAPTER I: THE ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE\nOECD TRANSFER PRICING GUIDELINES \u00a9 OECD 2017\n1.27 Contrary to the assertions of its advocates, global formulary\napportionment may in fact present intolerable compliance costs and data\nrequirements because information would have to be gathered about the\nentire MNE group and presented in each jurisdiction on the basis of the\ncurrency and the book and tax accounting rules of that particular\njurisdiction. Thus, the documentation and compliance requirements for an\napplication of global formulary apportionment would generally be more\nburdensome than under the separate entity approach of the arm's length\nprinciple. The costs of a global formulary apportionment would be further\nmagnified if not all countries could agree on the components of the formula\nor on the way the components are measured.\n1.28 Difficulties also would arise in determining the sales of each\nmember and in the valuation of assets (e.g. historic cost versus market\nvalue), especially in the valuation of intangibles.

However, the method becomes a\nless reliable substitute for arm\u2019s length transactions if not all the\ncharacteristics of these uncontrolled transactions that significantly affect the\nCHAPTER I: THE ARM'S LENGTH PRINCIPLE \u2013 47\nOECD TRANSFER PRICING GUIDELINES \u00a9 OECD 2017\nprice charged between independent enterprises are comparable. Similarly,\nthe resale price and cost plus methods compare the gross profit margin\nearned in the controlled transaction to gross profit margins earned in similar\nuncontrolled transactions. The comparison provides an estimate of the gross\nprofit margin one of the parties could have earned had it performed the same\nfunctions for independent enterprises and therefore provides an estimate of\nthe payment that party would have demanded, and the other party would\nhave been willing to pay, at arm\u2019s length for performing those functions.\nOther methods, as discussed in Chapter II, Part III, are based on\ncomparisons of net profit indicators (such as profit margins) between\nindependent and associated enterprises as a means to estimate the profits\nthat one or each of the associated enterprises could have earned had they\ndealt solely with independent enterprises, and therefore the payment those\nenterprises would have demanded at arm\u2019s length to compensate them for\nusing their resources in the controlled transaction. Where there are\ndifferences between the situations being compared that could materially\naffect the comparison, comparability adjustments must be made, where\npossible, to improve the reliability of the comparison. Therefore, in no event\ncan unadjusted industry average returns themselves establish arm\u2019s length\nprices.\n1.41 For a discussion of the relevance of these factors for the\n"

Neither the intangible risk itself, nor the residual income\nassociated with such risk, would be allocated to the service provider. See\nalso Example 1 in paragraph 1.83.\n"
